    "<p>The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Perform descriptive analytics <strong>to create a customer profile</strong> for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.</li>\n",
    "<li>For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct <strong>two-way contingency tables</strong> and compute all <strong>conditional and marginal probabilities</strong> along with their insights/impact on the business.</li>\n",

    "<p><strong>Dataset</strong></p>\n",
    "<p>The company collected the data on individuals who purchased a treadmill from the AeroFit stores during the prior three months. The dataset has the following features:</p>\n",
